This code is used for the paper 'A Novel Dynamic Reference Point Model for Preference-based Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization'.


- The Folder 'benchmark' is the experiment on the benchmark problems, i.e., DTLZ and WFG problems.
- The Folder 'pop' is the experiment on the portfolio optimization problems.

In each experiment, the file './Experiment/ex.m' is the enterance of the correpsonding proposed method.
